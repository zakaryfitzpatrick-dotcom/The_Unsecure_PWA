# Security Testing Approaches

Software Engineers should consider security and privacy at every phase of the SDLC to ensure that security is an integral part of the development process. As an application moves through phases of the SDLC, the cost of patching a vulnerability increases.

## Code review

Code review is the process of thoroughly examining and evaluating an application's source code to identify potential security vulnerabilities at the code level. It is a manual approach to white-box testing.

| Area of focus            | Questions to ask                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Static application security testing (SAST)

Static application security testing (SAST), or static analysis, is a testing methodology that analyses source code to find security vulnerabilities. It is usually an automated approach to white-box testing that scans an application before the code is compiled.

[List of SAST tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Source_Code_Analysis_Tools)

GitHub integrates a range of SAST tools; read the [GitHub Security Scan documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security).

| _SAST advantages_                                  | _SAST disadvantages_                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - Reduction in manual effort                       | - Unable to detect business logic flaws                        |
| - Time efficient                                   | - Cannot discover runtime issues                               |
| - Can be performed at the early stages of the SDLC | - Not well suited to track issues where user input is involved |
| - Offers 100% code coverage                        | - Requires access to the source code                           |
| - Provide an elaborate report                      | - Unable to provide application Specific Recommendations       |

## Dynamic application security testing (DAST)

Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is a testing methodology in which testers examine an application while it’s running but have no knowledge of the application’s internal interactions or designs at the system level and no access or visibility of application source code. This is an automated approach to black-box testing.

[List of DAST tools](https://owasp.org/www-community/Vulnerability_Scanning_Tools)

| _DAST advantages_                                               | _DAST disadvantages_                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Produces virtually no false positives                           | Requires working application to be tested                         |
| Can discover runtime issues                                     | Needs special testing infrastructure and customization            |
| Can discover issues based on user interaction with the software | Often performed towards the end of the software development cycle |
| Does not require access to the source code                      | Does not cover all code paths                                     |

## Vulnerability assessment

A vulnerability assessment is a systematic review of a system's security weaknesses. It evaluates whether the system is susceptible to any known vulnerabilities, assigns severity levels to those vulnerabilities, and recommends remediation or mitigation. The focus of a vulnerability assessment is infrastructure, processes, and practices. It is more about the organisation than the source code of a single application.

### Specific vulnerability assessments

- _Host assessment_ – The assessment of critical servers, which may be vulnerable to attacks.
- _Network assessment_ – The assessment of policies and practices to prevent unauthorized access to private or public networks and network-accessible resources.
- _Database assessment_ – The assessment of databases and data systems for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, identifying rogue datasets/databases or insecure dev/test environments.
- _Application scans_ – The identification of security vulnerabilities in web applications and their source code using DAST & SAST approaches.

### Threat Modelling vulnerabilities

Threat modelling is the process of using hypothetical scenarios, system diagrams, and testing to help secure systems and data. By identifying vulnerabilities, helping with risk assessment, and suggesting corrective action, threat modelling helps improve cybersecurity and trust in key business systems.

    <td><strong>Threat</strong></td>
    <td>A threat actor will intercept a username and password and then use the credentials to gain access to the system</td>

## Penetration testing

> [!Warning]
> Students MUST be extremely aware of the legal implications of performing unauthorised penetration testing. Students MUST only perform penetration tests on their applications or peers' applications with expressed permission.

Penetration testing (or pen testing) is a security exercise in which a cyber-security expert attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system. The purpose of this simulated attack is to identify any weak spots in a system’s defences that attackers could exploit by deploying the same strategies. Penetration testing requires the use of both automated tools and brute-force attacks.

### Types of penetration testing

- _White-box pen test_ - In a white-box pen test, the tester will perform tests with full knowledge of the application, often live watching the logs as they perform tests.
- _Grey-box pen test_ - In a grey-box pen test, the tester will perform tests with some knowledge on the application.
- _Black-box pen test_ - In a black-box pen test, the tester is given no background or insight into the source code and is only provided the front end of the application.
- Organisational level penetration testing such as _Covert pen test_, _External pen test_ and _Internal pen test_ are not in the scope of this course.

> [!Caution]
> For the [NESA software engineering syllabus](https://curriculum.nsw.edu.au/learning-areas/tas/software-engineering-11-12-2022/overview); students only need to know that penetration testing tools exist and have basic experience with using a tool and it's reporting capabilities. Students should not spend excessive time comparing or testing different tools.
